# Risk Assessment Framework

## Overview

The Risk Assessment Framework provides automated analysis of migration risks, helping organizations make informed decisions about customer migration priorities and strategies.

## Risk Categories

### 1. Technical Risk (Weight: 25%)

**Factors:**
- Channel type complexity (EDI > Thick Client > SOAP > SFTP > REST)
- Integration patterns (synchronous vs asynchronous)
- Protocol compatibility
- Data format transformations
- API version compatibility

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Legacy technology stack assessment
- Modern platform compatibility analysis
- Required adapters and transformations
- Technical debt evaluation

### 2. Business Risk (Weight: 30%)

**Factors:**
- Customer business criticality (low, medium, high, critical)
- Revenue impact
- SLA requirements
- Customer relationship status
- Contract obligations

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Customer tier classification
- Annual contract value
- Service level agreements
- Customer satisfaction scores

### 3. Compliance Risk (Weight: 25%)

**Factors:**
- Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2, GDPR, etc.)
- Data residency requirements
- Audit trail requirements
- Security certifications
- Industry-specific regulations

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Compliance requirement inventory
- Certification validation
- Data handling procedures
- Audit log requirements

### 4. Operational Risk (Weight: 15%)

**Factors:**
- Transaction volumes
- System dependencies
- Operating hours/uptime requirements
- Support availability
- Communication channels

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Daily/monthly transaction volumes
- Peak load analysis
- Downtime tolerance
- Support team readiness

### 5. Integration Risk (Weight: 5%)

**Factors:**
- Endpoint configuration status
- Authentication mechanisms
- Network connectivity
- Firewall rules
- Certificate management

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Configuration completeness
- Connectivity validation
- Security setup verification

## Risk Scoring

### Individual Risk Score
```
Risk Score = (Impact Score × Likelihood Score) / 100

Where:
- Impact Score: 0-100 (severity of failure)
- Likelihood Score: 0-100 (probability of occurrence)
```

### Overall Risk Score
```
Overall Score = Σ (Category Weight × Average Category Risk)
```

### Risk Levels

| Score Range | Risk Level | Color Code | Action Required |
|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0-30 | Low | Green | Standard migration process |
| 30-50 | Medium | Yellow | Enhanced monitoring and testing |
| 50-70 | High | Orange | Phased approach, extensive testing |
| 70-100 | Critical | Red | Executive approval, maximum precautions |

## Migration Readiness Score

The readiness score is calculated as:
```
Readiness Score = 100 - Overall Risk Score
```

**Interpretation:**
- **90-100**: Ready to migrate, low risk
- **70-89**: Ready with enhanced precautions
- **50-69**: Additional preparation needed
- **Below 50**: Not ready, significant work required

## Risk Factors by Channel Type

### EDI Channels
- **Technical**: High complexity (70/100 impact)
- **Integration**: Protocol mapping challenges
- **Business**: Trading partner coordination
- **Compliance**: Industry-specific standards

### SFTP Channels
- **Technical**: Medium complexity (40/100 impact)
- **Operational**: File schedule coordination
- **Integration**: Format validation
- **Security**: Credential management

### REST API Channels
- **Technical**: Low complexity (30/100 impact)
- **Integration**: Endpoint mapping
- **Operational**: Rate limiting
- **Security**: Authentication migration

### SOAP API Channels
- **Technical**: Medium complexity (50/100 impact)
- **Integration**: WSDL compatibility
- **Technical**: XML schema validation

### Thick Client Channels
- **Technical**: High complexity (65/100 impact)
- **Business**: User training requirements
- **Operational**: Deployment coordination
- **Business**: User adoption risk

## Mitigation Strategies

### High Transaction Volume
- **Risk**: Service degradation during migration
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Load testing in simulation phase
  - Gradual traffic shift
  - Capacity planning and scaling

### Compliance Requirements
- **Risk**: Regulatory violations
- **Mitigation**:
  - Compliance validation in test environment
  - Third-party compliance audit
  - Documentation and approval process

### Business Criticality
- **Risk**: Business disruption
- **Mitigation**:
  - Parallel run strategy
  - Extensive backup and rollback procedures
  - 24/7 support during cutover
  - Executive communication plan

### Legacy Technology
- **Risk**: Compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**:
  - Compatibility adapters
  - Extended testing period
  - Phased migration approach

### Missing Configuration
- **Risk**: Migration delays or failures
- **Mitigation**:
  - Configuration validation before migration
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Configuration templates

## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Gather customer and channel information
- Run automated risk analysis
- Generate risk report

### 2. Risk Review
- Review risk factors with stakeholders
- Identify additional risks
- Prioritize mitigation actions

### 3. Mitigation Planning
- Develop mitigation strategies
- Assign responsibilities
- Set timelines

### 4. Re-assessment
- Implement mitigations
- Re-run risk assessment
- Validate readiness improvement

### 5. Approval
- Present risk assessment to decision makers
- Obtain migration approval
- Document acceptance of residual risks

## Automated Risk Analysis

The platform automatically analyzes:
- Customer profile data
- Channel configurations
- Historical migration data
- Industry benchmarks
- Best practices

**Output:**
- Comprehensive risk report
- Recommended mitigation actions
- Migration readiness score
- Approval requirements

## Continuous Monitoring

Risk assessment continues throughout the migration:
- Pre-migration: Initial assessment
- During simulation: Validation of assumptions
- During migration: Real-time risk monitoring
- Post-migration: Retrospective analysis

## Reporting

### Risk Assessment Report Includes:
1. Executive summary
2. Overall risk score and level
3. Category-specific scores
4. Individual risk factors
5. Mitigation strategies
6. Migration readiness score
7. Recommended approach
