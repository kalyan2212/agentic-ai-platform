# System Architecture

## Overview

The B2B Customer Migration Platform is designed as a microservices-based, cloud-native platform that orchestrates the migration of B2B customers from legacy enterprise applications to modern platforms.

## Core Components

### 1. Migration Orchestration Engine

The orchestration engine is the heart of the platform, coordinating all migration activities across multiple channels and customers.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Create and manage migration plans
- Coordinate risk assessments
- Execute migration playbooks
- Monitor migration progress
- Handle rollbacks and failures

**Design Pattern:** Command Pattern with Event Sourcing

### 2. Risk Assessment Module

Automated risk analysis engine that evaluates migration readiness and identifies potential issues.

**Risk Categories:**
- **Technical Risk**: Channel complexity, integration patterns, API compatibility
- **Business Risk**: Customer criticality, revenue impact, SLA requirements
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2, etc.)
- **Operational Risk**: Transaction volumes, system dependencies, contact availability
- **Integration Risk**: Endpoint configuration, data mapping, protocol compatibility

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Risk Score = Σ (Category Weight × Average Category Risk)

Where:
- Technical: 25%
- Business: 30%
- Compliance: 25%
- Operational: 15%
- Integration: 5%

Individual Risk = (Impact Score × Likelihood Score) / 100
```

### 3. Channel-Specific Playbooks

Pre-configured migration strategies for different integration types.

**Supported Channels:**
1. **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**
   - X12, EDIFACT protocols
   - Document mapping and translation
   - Trading partner coordination

2. **SFTP (Secure File Transfer)**
   - File format validation
   - Schedule migration
   - Credential management

3. **REST/SOAP APIs**
   - Endpoint mapping
   - Authentication migration
   - Version compatibility

4. **Thick Client Applications**
   - Application modernization
   - User training
   - Desktop-to-web migration

### 4. Simulation Framework

Test and validate migrations before production cutover.

**Features:**
- Parallel execution (legacy + modern)
- Output comparison and validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Compliance validation

### 5. Cutover Coordination

Manages the actual transition from legacy to modern platform.

**Strategies:**
- **Phased**: Migrate channels sequentially over time
- **Big Bang**: All channels at once
- **Parallel Run**: Both systems simultaneously for validation period

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, FastAPI
- **Data Models**: Pydantic
- **Testing**: pytest
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Deployment**: Cloud-native (containerized)

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API design allows multiple instances
2. **Async Processing**: Long-running migrations handled asynchronously
3. **Event-Driven**: Event sourcing for audit trail and replay
4. **Database**: Designed for scalable storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**: API key / OAuth 2.0
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Encryption**: TLS in transit, encryption at rest
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations
5. **Secrets Management**: Secure credential storage

## High Availability

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Active-active across regions
2. **Database Replication**: Read replicas for scalability
3. **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backups, point-in-time recovery
4. **Rollback Capability**: Built-in rollback for all migrations

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Metrics**: Migration success rates, execution times, error rates
2. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
3. **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for complex workflows
4. **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for failures and anomalies

## Patent-Worthy Innovations

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated migration across channels with autonomous decision-making
2. **Automated Risk Scoring**: ML-enhanced risk assessment with readiness prediction
3. **Channel Playbooks**: Reusable, configurable migration strategies
4. **Simulation Framework**: Pre-production validation with legacy/modern comparison
5. **Autonomous Rollback**: Intelligent failure detection and automatic rollback
