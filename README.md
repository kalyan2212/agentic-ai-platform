# Enterprise Agentic Migration Platform

A patent-worthy prototype platform for simulating customer and data migration from mainframe legacy environments to cloud-native architectures.

## Overview

This platform demonstrates end-to-end simulated migration from mainframe systems (DB2, VSAM, COBOL, CICS, IMS) to cloud-native architectures (microservices, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, EDI, thick client, batch processing).

## Patent-Worthy Innovations

- **Multi-agent orchestration engine** for end-to-end migration coordination
- **Adaptive agent communication protocols** with dynamic routing, consensus, and autonomous conflict resolution
- **AI-driven legacy-to-modern simulation** for both mainframe and cloud-native environments
- **Synthetic data generators** for DB2/VSAM to PostgreSQL migration
- **Autonomous risk assessment and rollback strategies** during simulated migration

## Usage

### Running a Simple Migration Simulation

```python
from src.migration.orchestrator import MigrationOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = MigrationOrchestrator()

# Run a complete migration simulation
result = orchestrator.run_migration(
    source='db2_legacy',
    target='postgresql_cloud',
    workflow='api_driven'
)

print(f"Migration completed: {result.status}")
print(f"Data migrated: {result.records_migrated} records")
print(f"Time elapsed: {result.duration}")
```

### Running Test Scenarios

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
python tests/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py
```
