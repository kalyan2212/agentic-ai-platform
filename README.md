# Intelligent B2B Customer Migration Platform

A patent-worthy platform that enables the migration of B2B customers from legacy enterprise applications to modern cloud-native platforms with multi-channel orchestration, risk assessment, and intelligent cutover management.

## Overview

This platform addresses the complex challenge of migrating B2B customers from legacy enterprise applications to modern cloud-native platforms across multiple integration channels (EDI, SFTP, API, thick client).

## Patent-Worthy Innovations

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: AI-powered orchestration for B2B customer/channel migration
2. **Automated Risk Analysis**: Migration readiness scoring with automated risk assessment
3. **Channel-Specific Playbooks**: Pre-configured migration strategies for EDI, API, SFTP, and thick client
4. **Simulation Framework**: Legacy-to-modern cutover validation before going live
5. **Autonomous Rollback**: Intelligent risk mitigation and rollback engine
6. **Real-Time Tracking**: Live migration progress monitoring and reporting

## Architecture

The platform consists of the following core components:

### Core Modules

- **Migration Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates multi-channel migration workflows
- **Risk Assessment Module**: Analyzes and scores migration risks
- **Channel Mapping Engine**: Maps legacy integrations to modern platform equivalents
- **Simulation Environment**: Validates migrations before production cutover
- **Cutover Coordinator**: Manages phased migration and rollback
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time progress tracking and reporting

### Supported Integration Channels

- **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**: Tibco EDI, X12, EDIFACT
- **SFTP**: Secure File Transfer Protocol
- **REST/SOAP APIs**: Modern and legacy web services
- **Thick Client**: Desktop applications and terminal services

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kalyan2212/agentic-ai-platform.git
cd agentic-ai-platform

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

```

## Usage

### Starting the API Server

```bash
python -m src.api.main
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### API Documentation

Once the server is running, access the interactive API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### Example: Creating a Migration Plan

```python
from src.orchestration.migration_orchestrator import MigrationOrchestrator
from src.models.customer import Customer, IntegrationChannel, ChannelType

# Create customer
customer = Customer(
    customer_id="CUST001",
    name="Acme Corporation",
    channels=[
        IntegrationChannel(
            channel_id="CH001",
            channel_type=ChannelType.EDI,
            config={"protocol": "X12", "version": "4010"}
        )
    ]
)

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = MigrationOrchestrator()

# Create migration plan
plan = orchestrator.create_migration_plan(customer)

# Execute migration
result = orchestrator.execute_migration(plan.plan_id)
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```
